\chapter*{Introduction}
In the fields of digital technologies, it is possible to consider an information as a series of bits which represents a message. Thus, watermarking is the technical solution which consists in hiding a message in a given signal. 

This project will deal with the main algorithms used to watermark data in audio signals.

We will first present the theory behind common algorithms, present the evaluation methods, and then move on to the project and implementation parts : how the project was managed, and how the project was implemented.
Finally, we will show the results of our evaluations.
