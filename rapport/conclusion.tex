\chapter*{Conclusion}
This project was very long and more difficult than we thought at first, hence some lacking functionalities and expected features when comparing the actual state with what was expected when reading the Gantt diagram.

However, we feel satisfied with the resulting work, because it is globally stable and as much bug-free as possible, with a convenient user interface and an excellent scalability and extensibility.

We could acquire a lot of skills in the domain of signal processing and understand points that are commonplace in DSP algorithms, and we feel that most of what we have coded could be reused in side applications : for instance, instead of watermarking algorithms, our library could be easily used to implement and evaluate high performance signal encryption, speech recognition, or any other kind of audio algorithms.

Since the library is pure \brand{C++} with very few dependencies, it could also be used in embedded applications. For instance, it has been tested with success as a guitar effect pedal simulator on a \brand{BeagleBoard}.

Finally, we could run some real-life tests and research, and even resort to using other people for evaluation, which was quite interesting even if we did not have the time nor the resources to make it on a big scale.
