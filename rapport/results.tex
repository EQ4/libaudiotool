\section{Evaluation results}
The evaluation has been made for the \ac{LSB} (the reference), the \ac{RLSB} and the \ac{SSW} technique with the \texttt{Amplify}, \texttt{Convolution} (with a low-pass filter) and \texttt{FFTAmplify} degradations. The scores (number of false bits) are :

\section{Auditory results}
The auditory evaluation, made on about ten persons, wasn't really relevant. The watermark made on the audio files were audible, all of the persons reported a difference. Added to this, the audio files watermarked with the LSB method showed lot of noise, the original song wasn't audible. The experiment with the SSW technique were more relevant as the song was still audible.
